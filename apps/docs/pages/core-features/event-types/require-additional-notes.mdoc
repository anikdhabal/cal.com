title: "Require additional notes"

{% label /%}

Similar to additional inputs, you can make additional notes required for booking and potential attendees won't be able to complete the booking without filling out this section.

The additional notes section is already a part of our booking logic, so this feature is useful if you want your attendees to present their case or provide the reason for the booking. That way, if your event type also requires confirmation, you can determine better which meetings you'd like to confirm or decline.
